# Aditya's Notes
## Polymorphism
+ **Compile Time Polymorphism**
  <br> Polymorphism that exist at the time of **Compilation** is called Compile Time Polymorphism. It is also called static polymorphism or early binding. Compile-time polymorphism is achieved by method overloading and operator overloading.
  + **Method Overloading** 
  <br> Whenever class contain more than one Method with **same name but with different parameter** is called Method Overloading. Method Overloading occurs when a class has many methods with the same name but different parameters. Two or more methods may have the same name if they have other numbers of parameters, different data types, or different numbers of parameters and different data types. 
  <br> For Example: 
  <br> void gfg() { ... }
+ void gfg(int num1 ) { ... }
+ void gfg(float num1) { ... }
+ void gfg(int num1 , float num2 ) { ... }
